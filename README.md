# The team

This app was designed and implemented by Ammon Orgill and Matthew Walters in a 5 day sprint.


# User Stories

As a student, I want to:
- Search for a teacher of my instrument of choice
- Read reviews and view the overall rating
- Send an inquiry to a teacher, provides availability, what theyâ€™re looking for
- Add/edit/delete a review/rating

As a teacher, I want to: 
- Create/edit a teacher account and profile
- View lesson inquiries, mark as "Seen", and sort inquiries accordingly

# App Flow
The app home page displays two sections, one for students to begin their music teacher search, one for teachers to signup or login. 

Students can begin their search by selecting their instrument of choice from a drop down menu. After selecting "Search," users are taken to a results page displaying teacher profile cards with their photo and high-level information, namely name, location, years of experience, and rating. Students can click on a profile card to view the teacher's full bio, including name, location, years of experience, rating, instruments they teach, and student reviews. Two buttons are located below the primary profile information, including on this page, including "Leave "Go back to search results", "Start a new search", and "Send inq"

Teachers can begin by selecting the "Signup" button which takes them to a form to input their name, username, and a password. After signing up, teachers are taken to another form where they can begin filling out their profile information (including all detail fields listed in above paragraph.) After submitting the form, teachers are taken to their Teacher Dashboard. Once they receive an inquiry, the inquiry card will be displayed. Teachers can sort their inquiries by "Viewed" or "New". Each inquiry card will have a button to mark the inquiry as "Viewed."

# Sprint Breakdown

* Day one (Wednesday):
    * create databases 
    * stub out backend Django routes
* Day two (Thursday):
    * ensure data CRUD with Django admin profile
    * Stub out Next.js routes
* Day three (Friday):
    * Create front-end forms for lesson inquiries 
    * Create teacher dashboard/profile
    * Create rough partials for navbar/footer
* Day four (Saturday):
    * Finish up routing and ensure functionality on all pages
    * Get pages in rough layouts to match wireframes
* Day five (Sunday):
    * tweak CSS, ensure color/style cohesion
    * clean up code and deploy


# MVP
- Render a home page, search results page, teacher profile page, and teacher dashboard page
- Render sign up forms, login forms, and music teacher inquiry forms 
- Set up sequelize ORM models and tables
- Connect to backend server and databases using Django and RESTful routing principles
- Deployed online


# Stretch Goals
- Location-based search
- Students can create profile pages
- Option to send an email that opens up outlook

# Post project reflections

## hurdles/roadblocks
* Our biggest hurdle was generally learning Django on the fly. With user auth and building out the api routes, this part ended up taking a lot more of our time than we anticipated 
* Another hurdle was figuring out using localStorage to keep a user logged in once they were authorized

## future plans
* include a seach function for students to find a teacher that teaches the instrument they are looking for
